**Role**
<br> Programmer & Research Assistant

**Description**
<br>This project was made on Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints. I was hired by
a professor from the University of Portsmouth to recreate and improve an experience
in Unreal. I was recommended by two of my lecturers for this project. The client
claimed to be very satisfied with the end result. There is no public demo for this
project as this was under NDA. I have obtained permission to put this in my portfolio
after the development process was done.
