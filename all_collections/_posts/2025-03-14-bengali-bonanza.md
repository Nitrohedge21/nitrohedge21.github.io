**Role**
<br> Programmer

**Description**
<br>This project was made on Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints. This is my 
team's submission to our university's game jam(2023). We had four days to
make a project and this is what we have made. I was one of the three programmers
in this project. I've worked on the waypoints system for the NPCs, implemented
the SFX and menus, and their dialogue.
