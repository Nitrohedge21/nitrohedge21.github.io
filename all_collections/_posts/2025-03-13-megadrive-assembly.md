**Role**
<br> Developer

**Description**
<br>I developed a Sega Mega Drive project using 68K assembly, exploring low-level
programming and classic hardware constraints. I enjoyed working within the system’s
limitations to create a functional and engaging experience. This project involved 
handling sprite rendering and input processing within the emulator environment.
Throughout development, I referenced the official documentation to better understand
the hardware’s capabilities and behavior. While I have tested it extensively on emulators,
I have yet to verify its functionality on actual hardware, making it an interesting area
for future exploration.

The project was tested on Gens & Kega Fusion but should be playable on other emulators too.
