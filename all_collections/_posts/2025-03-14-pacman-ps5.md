**Role**
<br> Programmer

**Description**
<br>
​One of the modules in my course let's us utilise PS5 Dev Kits to make a project
for the assessment. For this said module, me and 2 other classmates (all programmers)
decided to work as a group and see if we could recreate a 2D game using the PS5 SDK. 
I'm not allowed to share the source code due to the NDA.​

This project is a basic, yet complicated, recreation of the original Pac-Man arcade
game on the PS5. This project is in no way shape or farm affiliated with Namco.
