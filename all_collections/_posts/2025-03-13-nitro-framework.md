**Description**
<br>
This project tries to replicate the gameplay of Sonic The Hedgehog 
while mixing the different gameplay styles from multiple previous
titles using Unreal Engine 5. This project was made to support my dissertation
where I proposed ways to improve the gameplay of Sonic The Hedgehog.
However, it has become a personal project of mine, once again.
