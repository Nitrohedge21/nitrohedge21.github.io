**Role**
<br> Programmer

**Description**
<br>This project was made on Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints. This is my team's
submission to Global Game Jam 2024. We had four days to make a project based on
the theme "make me laugh" and this is what we have made. I was one of the three
programmers in this project. I've worked on the customer NPCs, random order
selection system and a few more things that were cut due to time constraints.
