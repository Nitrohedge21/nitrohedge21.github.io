**Role**
<br> Programmer

**Description**
<br>This project was made on Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints. I was hired by
a few lecturers from the University of Portsmouth to build the foundation, essentially the framework,
for the story game project called "Locked In". As this project was under NDA, I'm unable to provide
the link to the respository.
